// Import the Material Design visual design language package
// This package is used to create the UI of the app

// Define a StatelessWidget named CustomizeScreen
// StatelessWidget is a widget that describes part of the user interface which can depend on configuration but does not depend on mutable state

  // Define a static constant routeName with the value '/customize'
  // This constant is used to identify the route for this screen in the navigation system

  // The key argument is used by the Flutter framework to identify widgets in the widget tree
  const CustomizeScreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  // Override the build method to return a Container
  // This method is called when Flutter needs to build the UI of CustomizeScreen
  // Currently, it returns an empty Container, which is a convenience widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing widgets
